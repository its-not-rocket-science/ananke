  - `GranaryState { polityId, grain_su }` — grain reserves in supply units (1 su = food for 1 person for 1 day); capacity derived dynamically from `polity.population × GRANARY_CAPACITY_DAYS = 730`.
  - `createGranary(polity)` — initialises with one year of consumption.
  - `computeCapacity(polity)` → integer; `computeFoodSupply_Q(polity, granary)` → Q [0, SCALE.Q] — feeds directly into Phase-86 `stepPolityPopulation(foodSupply_Q)`.
  - **Harvest yield**: `HARVEST_BASE_SU_PER_CAPITA = 250` su/person/harvest; `HARVEST_YIELD_BASE_Q = q(0.70)` floor; `HARVEST_STABILITY_BONUS_Q = q(0.30)` max bonus from stability. `deriveHarvestYieldFactor(polity, season_Q?)` integrates Phase-78 seasonal multiplier.
  - `computeHarvestYield(polity, yieldFactor_Q?)` → su; `triggerHarvest(polity, granary, yieldFactor_Q?)` → added su (clamped to capacity).
  - `stepGranaryConsumption(polity, granary, elapsedDays)` → consumed su; drains `population × elapsedDays` su per step; floors at 0.
  - `tradeFoodSupply(fromGranary, toGranary, toPolity, amount_su)` → transferred su; limited by source grain, destination capacity. Integrates with Phase-83 trade routes.
  - `raidGranary(granary, raidFraction_Q?)` → plundered su; defaults to `RAID_FRACTION_Q = q(0.40)`. Integrates with Phase-84 siege attacker victory.
  - Added `./granary` subpath export to `package.json`.
  - 47 new tests; 4,608 total. Coverage maintained above all thresholds.

  - Annual Q rates for birth and death (fraction of population per year) to preserve fixed-point precision.
  - `BASELINE_BIRTH_RATE_ANNUAL_Q = q(0.035)` (≈ 3.5%/year); `BASELINE_DEATH_RATE_ANNUAL_Q = q(0.030)` (≈ 3.0%/year).
  - `computeBirthRate(polity)` → Q: morale linearly scales rate between 50% and 150% of baseline.
  - `computeDeathRate(polity, deathPressure_Q?, foodSupply_Q?)` → Q: baseline reduced by tech era (`TECH_ERA_DEATH_MUL`), plus instability bonus (up to `INSTABILITY_DEATH_ANNUAL_Q = q(0.015)`), optional external pressure, and famine bonus (`FAMINE_DEATH_ANNUAL_Q = q(0.030)`).
  - `computeNetGrowthRate(polity, ...)` → signed number (may be negative).
  - `stepPolityPopulation(polity, elapsedDays, deathPressure_Q?, foodSupply_Q?)` → `DemographicsStepResult`: mutates `polity.population`; formula `round(population × netAnnualRate_Q × days / (365 × SCALE.Q))`; clamps to ≥ 0.
  - **Famine**: `FAMINE_THRESHOLD_Q = q(0.20)` — food below this activates extra mortality and migration push.
  - `computeFamineMigrationPush(foodSupply_Q)` → Q [0, `FAMINE_MIGRATION_PUSH_Q = q(0.30)`]: linear from zero (at threshold) to peak (at food = 0); integrates with Phase-81 push pressure.
  - `computeCarryingCapacity(polity)` — soft cap by tech era (Stone 50 k → Modern 200 M); `isOverCapacity(polity)`.
  - `estimateAnnualBirths` / `estimateAnnualDeaths` — reporting utilities.
  - Phase-56 (disease) and Phase-84 (siege) integrate via `deathPressure_Q`; Phase-81 (migration) integrates via `computeFamineMigrationPush`; Phase-78 (calendar) via caller-supplied seasonal multipliers.
  - Added `./demography` subpath export to `package.json`.
  - 51 new tests; 4,561 total. Coverage maintained above all thresholds.

  - `computeConversionPressure(faith, missionaryPresence_Q)` → Q: `fervor_Q × missionaryPresence_Q × CONVERSION_BASE_RATE_Q / SCALE.Q²`; `CONVERSION_BASE_RATE_Q = q(0.002)`.
  - `stepFaithConversion(registry, polityId, faithId, delta_Q)` — exclusive faith gains displace other exclusive faiths proportionally; syncretic faiths unaffected.
  - `computeHeresyRisk(registry, polityId)` → Q: fires when dominant exclusive faith has low tolerance and a minority exclusive faith exceeds `HERESY_THRESHOLD_Q = q(0.15)`; integrates with Phase-82 espionage religious unrest.
  - `computeFaithDiplomaticModifier(registry, polityAId, polityBId)` → signed number: `+FAITH_DIPLOMATIC_BONUS_Q = q(0.10)` for shared dominant faith; `−FAITH_DIPLOMATIC_PENALTY_Q = q(0.10)` for exclusive vs exclusive conflict; 0 for syncretic or no dominant faith.

  - **Active phase**: wall decay = `siegeStrength_Q × WALL_DECAY_BASE_Q / SCALE.Q` per day; supply drains at `SUPPLY_DRAIN_PER_DAY_Q = q(0.004)`; morale tracks combined wall/supply weakness.
  - **Assault**: fires when `wallIntegrity_Q < ASSAULT_WALL_THRESHOLD_Q = q(0.30)`; resolved by `eventSeed` roll weighted by siege strength and defender morale deficit.
  - **Surrender**: fires when `supplyLevel_Q ≤ SURRENDER_SUPPLY_THRESHOLD_Q = q(0.05)` and daily probabilistic roll succeeds based on morale deficit.
  - `stepSiege(siege, worldSeed, tick, supplyPressureBonus_Q?, siegeStrengthMul_Q?)` — Phase-83 (severed trade) and Phase-78 (winter penalty) integration via optional parameters.

  - `deriveNarrativeTone(culture)` — maps dominant `CultureProfile` value → `ProseTone`
    via `VALUE_TONE_MAP` (martial_virtue→martial, spiritual_devotion→spiritual,
    commerce→mercantile, honour→heroic, fatalism→tragic; others fall back to neutral).
  - `mythArchetypeFrame(archetype)` — returns a culturally-flavoured closing phrase for
    each `MythArchetype` (hero, monster, trickster, great_plague, divine_wrath, golden_age).
  - `createNarrativeContext(entityNames, culture?, myth?)` — bundles tone + name map + myth frame.
  - `renderEntryWithTone(entry, ctx)` — picks the tone variant for each event, substitutes
    `{name}`, `{target}`, computed helper strings (`{cause_str}`, `{location_str}`, etc.),
    raw `entry.variables`, and appends the myth frame (replacing terminal period).

## [0.1.18] — 2026-03-26

### Added

- **CE-18 · External Agent Interface** (`tools/agent-server.ts`)
  - WebSocket server (default port 3001) implementing an agent observation/action loop
    over the existing `stepWorld` kernel — no src/ changes, no new npm exports.
  - **Protocol:**
    - Client → `{ type: "step", commands?: AgentCommand[] }` or `{ type: "reset" }`
    - Server → `{ type: "obs", tick, entities: ObservationSlice[], done, winner? }`
    - On connect → `{ type: "init", config, obs }`
  - **`ObservationSlice`** — safe subset: position, velocity, fatigue, shock/consciousness/dead,
    detected nearby enemies (filtered via Phase 52 `canDetect`). No raw internals exposed.
  - **`AgentCommand`** — validated high-level actions: `attack | move | dodge | flee | idle`.
    Invalid team targeting silently dropped; `decideCommandsForEntity` fills in missing commands.
  - Configurable scenario: `TEAM1_SIZE` / `TEAM2_SIZE` (1–4 each), `SEED`, `MAX_TICKS` via env vars.
    Default: 1v1, Knight (longsword + mail) vs Brawler (club).
  - Agent-driven stepping: server advances only when client sends `step` — agent controls tick rate.
  - Determinism preserved: external commands injected via existing `CommandMap` before `stepWorld`.
  - HTTP endpoints: `GET /config`, `GET /status`, `POST /reset`.
  - Run: `npm run agent-server`
  - **Success criterion met:** An external Python script using only `websockets` can drive a single
    entity through a 1v1 fight, receiving `ObservationSlice` observations each tick and submitting
    `attack` / `move` commands, without importing any Ananke TypeScript.

  - `NPIType`, `NPIRecord`, `NPIRegistry` — non-pharmaceutical intervention registry;
    `applyNPI / removeNPI / hasNPI` helpers. `mask_mandate` reduces airborne transmission
    by `NPI_MASK_REDUCTION_Q = q(0.60)` (60 %). `quarantine` recorded for host-side pair
    filtering.
  - `computeTransmissionRisk` extended with optional 5th `options?` parameter — backward-
    compatible; applies vaccination, age susceptibility, and NPI effects when present.
  - `computeR0(profile, entityMap)` — basic reproductive number estimate
    (β × infectious-days × min(15, population−1)); used for validation.
  - `stepSEIR(entity, delta_s, profile, worldSeed, tick)` — SEIR-aware entity step that
    isolates a single disease profile; delegates to Phase 56 `stepDiseaseForEntity` for
    full backward compatibility.
  - `registerDiseaseProfile(profile)` — registers custom/SEIR profiles into the lookup map
    without modifying the canonical `DISEASE_PROFILES` array.
  - `MEASLES` profile (`useSeir: true`): R0 ≈ 15.1 in population ≥ 16, 14-day incubation,
    14-day infectious period, 0.2 % IFR, permanent immunity. Validates epidemic curve
    peaking days 10–20 and burning out by day 60 (matches standard SIR output ±15 %).
  - `entity.vaccinations?: VaccinationRecord[]` added to `Entity`.
  - `DiseaseProfile.useSeir?: boolean` opt-in field (no effect on existing callers).
  - 37 new tests in `test/disease-seir.test.ts`. All 37 Phase 56 tests pass unmodified.
  - **3 998 tests total.**

## [0.1.16] — 2026-03-25

### Added

- **CE-5 · Persistent World Server** — campaign ↔ combat battle bridge:
  - src/battle-bridge.ts: pure functions translating polity state to
    BattleConfig and BattleOutcome back to PolityImpact[]. Covers
    tech-era→loadout mapping, military-strength→team-size scaling,
    deterministic battle seed, morale/stability/population impact.
    27 tests in test/battle-bridge.test.ts.
  - tools/persistent-world.ts: integrated server running polity tick +
    synchronous tactical battles every 7 days per active war. Battle
    outcomes mutate polity morale, stability, and population. Full
    checkpoint/resume, WebSocket push, HTTP war/peace/save/reset/battles
    endpoints. Run with: npm run persistent-world

---

## [0.1.15] — 2026-03-25

### Added

- **CE-5 · WebAssembly Kernel** — shadow-mode WASM acceleration for push repulsion and
  injury accumulation:
  - `as/units.ts` — AssemblyScript port of `src/units.ts` (all 13 exports: SCALE constants,
    `q()`, `clampQ()`, `qMul()`, `qDiv()`, `mulDiv()`, `sqrtQ()`, `cbrtQ()`, unit
    converters).  Compiled to `dist/as/units.wasm`.
  - `as/push.ts` — pair-wise position repulsion kernel in flat WASM memory (64-entity
    capacity, octagonal distance approximation, overflow-safe i64 arithmetic).
    Compiled to `dist/as/push.wasm`.
  - `as/injury.ts` — per-entity injury accumulation inner loop (clotting, bleed→fluid,
    shock, consciousness, death check) matching `src/sim/step/injury.ts` constants exactly.
    Compiled to `dist/as/injury.wasm`.
  - `src/wasm-kernel.ts` — Node.js host bridge.  `WasmKernel.shadowStep(world, tick)`
    marshals entity state into WASM memory, runs both kernels, and returns a
    `WasmStepReport` with per-entity velocity deltas and projected vitals.  Shadow mode:
    outputs are never applied to world state — used for validation and diagnostics only.
  - `loadWasmKernel()` factory loads `push.wasm` + `injury.wasm` from `dist/as/` at
    runtime via `import.meta.url` + `readFileSync`.
  - Exported as `@its-not-rocket-science/ananke/wasm-kernel`.
  - `dist/as/` (compiled WASM binaries) included in the published package.
  - 61 WASM unit tests (`test/as/`) covering units, push repulsion, and injury
    accumulation parity with the TypeScript reference implementation.
  - Build scripts: `npm run build:wasm:all`, `npm run test:wasm`.

### Added

- **Phase 71 · Cultural Generation & Evolution Framework** (`src/culture.ts`)
  - Reverse WOAC method: derives culture bottom-up from five forces (`environment`,
    `power`, `exchange`, `legacy`, `belief`) scored from simulation state.
  - `generateCulture(polity, registry, myths, vassals?, biome?)` → `CultureProfile`
    with 10 possible `CulturalValue` types, `CulturalContradiction` pairs, and
    `CulturalCycle` practices (CYCLES audit).
  - `stepCultureYear(profile, techPressure_Q, militaryOutcome_Q, myths, worldSeed, tick)`
    → `CultureYearResult { profile, schism? }`: tech diffusion pulls exchange force
    upward; military outcomes shift power; new myths update legacy/belief; conservative
    cultures with high tension fire deterministic `SchismEvent` (reform_movement,
    heresy, or civil_unrest).
  - `describeCulture(profile)` → `{ summary, values, contradictions, cycles }`:
    human-readable output for writers and game designers.
  - Query helpers: `getCulturalValue`, `getDominantValues`, `getSignificantContradictions`.
  - Integrates with Phase 70 (vassal count → power force), Phase 66 (myths → legacy/belief),
    Phase 68 (BiomeContext → environment harshness), Phase 23 dialogue and Phase 24
    faction standing via exported profile queries.
  - 45 tests in `test/culture.test.ts`; exported via `ananke/campaign` subpath.

- **Phase 70 · Stratified Political Simulation ("Vassal Web" Layer)** (`src/polity-vassals.ts`)
  - `VassalNode` — intermediate layer between Entity and Polity with `territory_Q`,
    `military_Q`, `treasury_cu`, and a `VassalLoyalty` block.
  - Seven `LoyaltyType` variants with distinct `stepVassalLoyalty` dynamics:
    `ideological` (slow, conviction-driven), `transactional` (treasury comparison),
    `terrified` (instant collapse if liege appears weak), `honor_bound` (oath + grievance
    spike), `opportunistic` (tracks liege/rival morale ratio), `kin_bound` (stable family
    ties), `ideological_rival` (constant decay, cannot recover).
  - `applyGrievanceEvent` — immutable grievance accumulation (host applies broken-promise,
    tax-hike, kin-death events).
  - `computeVassalContribution` — loyalty-scaled troop and treasury output; zero below
    `CONTRIBUTION_FLOOR_Q` (q(0.20)), full above `CONTRIBUTION_FULL_Q` (q(0.50)).
  - `computeEffectiveMilitary` — sums contributions for command-chain filtering before
    passing force ratio to Phase 69 `resolveTacticalEngagement`.
  - `detectRebellionRisk` — Q score (70% low-loyalty + 30% high-grievance) for AI queries.
  - `resolveSuccessionCrisis` — deterministic heir-support rolls weighted by `military_Q`;
    winners gain +q(0.05) loyalty, losers −q(0.08); `SuccessionResult` with `supportQ`
    and per-vassal `loyaltyDeltas`.
  - 40 tests in `test/polity-vassals.test.ts`; exported via `ananke/campaign` subpath.

- **Option B · Tier 2 subpath exports** — eight new named import subpaths for all
  Tier 2 module groupings; deep imports remain supported as a fallback:
  - `ananke/character` → aging, sleep, disease, wound-aging, thermoregulation, nutrition,
    medical, toxicology, progression
  - `ananke/combat` → ranged, grapple, formation-combat, mount, hazard, morale, sensory,
    sensory-extended, weather, terrain, skills, biome
  - `ananke/campaign` → campaign, downtime, collective-activities, settlement,
    settlement-services, inventory, item-durability, world-generation, inheritance,
    economy, polity (campaign layer barrel)
  - `ananke/social` → dialogue, faction, relationships, relationships-effects, party,
    quest, quest-generators
  - `ananke/narrative` → chronicle, story-arcs, narrative-render, legend, mythology,
    narrative, narrative-stress, metrics, arena
  - `ananke/anatomy` → existing `src/anatomy/index.ts` barrel
  - `ananke/crafting` → existing `src/crafting/index.ts` barrel
  - `ananke/competence` → existing `src/competence/index.ts` barrel
  - `STABLE_API.md` updated to document preferred subpath import patterns.

- **CE-16 · Modding Support** (`src/modding.ts`)
  - Layer 1 — `hashMod(json)`: deterministic FNV-1a fingerprint (8-char hex) for any
    parsed JSON mod file; canonical key-sorted serialisation ensures order-independence.
  - Layer 2 — Post-tick behavior hooks: `registerPostTickHook / unregisterPostTickHook /
    runPostTickHooks / listPostTickHooks / clearPostTickHooks`; hooks fire after
    `stepWorld`, are purely observational (logging, analytics, renderer updates).
  - Layer 3 — AI behavior node registry: `registerBehaviorNode / unregisterBehaviorNode /
    getBehaviorNode / listBehaviorNodes / clearBehaviorNodes`; custom `BehaviorNode`
    factories registered by id for scenario and behavior-tree composition.
  - Session fingerprint: `computeModManifest(catalogIds)` returns sorted id lists and a
    single fingerprint covering all three layers for multiplayer client validation.
  - `clearAllMods()` resets hooks and behavior nodes (catalog unchanged).
  - 42 tests in `test/modding.test.ts`; exported via `src/index.ts`.

- **CE-14 · Socio-Economic Campaign Layer → Stable Promotion**
  - Promote `stepPolityDay`, `declareWar`, `makePeace`, `areAtWar`,
    `createPolity`, `createPolityRegistry`, `Polity`, `PolityRegistry`,
    `PolityPair` (`src/polity.ts`), `stepTechDiffusion`, `computeDiffusionPressure`,
    `totalInboundPressure`, `techEraName` (`src/tech-diffusion.ts`), and
    `applyEmotionalContagion`, `stepEmotionalWaves`, `computeEmotionalSpread`,
    `triggerMilitaryRout`, `triggerVictoryRally`, `netEmotionalPressure`,
    `EmotionalWave` (`src/emotional-contagion.ts`) from Tier 2 (Experimental)
    to Tier 1 (Stable) in `STABLE_API.md`.
  - Add `export *` re-exports to `src/polity.ts` so the `ananke/polity` subpath
    delivers the complete Socio-Economic Campaign Layer in one import.
  - Freeze `Polity`, `PolityRegistry`, `PolityPair` and `EmotionalWave` interfaces
    with `@stable CE-14` JSDoc annotations — no required-field additions without a
    minor bump, no renames without a major bump.

### Migration guide — v0.1.x → v0.2.0

This is a **non-breaking promotion**.  No existing code needs to change.

#### What is new

The Socio-Economic Campaign Layer (`polity`, `tech-diffusion`, `emotional-contagion`)
is now Tier 1 (Stable).  You can depend on it without fear of silent API churn.

#### Import change (optional)

Instead of importing from the package root:

```typescript
import { stepPolityDay }       from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke";
import { stepTechDiffusion }   from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke";
import { applyEmotionalContagion } from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke";
```

You may now import from the dedicated subpath (recommended for tree-shaking):

```typescript
import {
  stepPolityDay,
  stepTechDiffusion,
  applyEmotionalContagion,
  EmotionalWave,
} from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke/polity";
```

Both forms remain supported indefinitely.

#### Interface freeze guarantees (from v0.2.0)

| Interface | Guarantee |
|-----------|-----------|
| `Polity` | Existing fields never renamed/removed without major bump |
| `PolityRegistry` | `polities`, `activeWars`, `alliances` fields frozen |
| `PolityPair` | `polityAId`, `polityBId`, `sharedLocations`, `routeQuality_Q` frozen |
| `EmotionalWave` | `profileId`, `sourcePolityId`, `intensity_Q`, `daysActive` frozen |

Adding new **optional** fields to these interfaces is never a breaking change.
