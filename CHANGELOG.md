Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-02

### Changed

- **Tier-1 API contraction (host-contract hardening):** root export `@its-not-rocket-science/ananke` now contains only the minimal stable host-facing contract:
  - fixed-point utilities
  - core host-required types
  - world creation / scenario loading
  - stepping
  - replay / serialization
  - bridge extraction
- Added `docs/stable-api-manifest.json` as the machine-readable Tier-1 source of truth.
- Added CI guard `check-stable-api` to fail builds if `src/index.ts` exports drift from the manifest.
- Added explicit aggregate subpaths:
  - `@its-not-rocket-science/ananke/tier2`
  - `@its-not-rocket-science/ananke/tier3`

### Migration guide

If you previously imported non-core symbols from the root path, migrate as follows:

1. **Keep root imports only for Tier-1 symbols** listed in `STABLE_API.md`.
2. Move removed root imports to explicit subpaths:
   - Tier 2: `@its-not-rocket-science/ananke/tier2` (or existing domain subpaths such as `/combat`, `/campaign`, `/social`, `/narrative`, `/anatomy`, `/crafting`, `/competence`, `/species`, `/polity`, `/catalog`).
   - Tier 3: `@its-not-rocket-science/ananke/tier3`.
3. Example:

```ts
// before
import { stepWorld, BridgeEngine, resolveTacticalEngagement } from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke";

// after
import { stepWorld } from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke";
import { BridgeEngine } from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke/tier2";
import { resolveTacticalEngagement } from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke/tier3";
```

### Notes

- This release intentionally tightens the semver-stable surface to improve long-term supportability.
- No Tier-1 symbol was removed without a documented migration path.

## [0.1.69] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **PM-10 — Maintenance Budget Roadmap (complete):**
  - `docs/maintenance-policy.md` (new): standing maintenance commitments covering:
    - **Docs reconciliation** — `generate-module-index` + `generate-recipes-matrix` must match committed files before every release.
    - **Issue triage cadence** — P0 (regression) same day; P1 (correctness) within one week; P2 (enhancement) roadmap-tracked; P3 (docs) best-effort.
    - **Migration maintenance** — every minor version bump that changes a `@core` field must ship a registered migration in `src/schema-migration.ts`.
    - **SDK parity policy** — Unity, Godot, and Web sidecars must update to the current `BRIDGE_SCHEMA_VERSION` within one minor release.
    - **Example and corpus upkeep** — all `examples/` compile cleanly; `npm run verify-corpus` passes on every release.
    - **Content-pack schema evolution** — minor bumps are backward-compatible; major bumps ship a migration tool.
    - **Coverage floor** — statements 90%, branches 80%, functions 85%, lines 90%.
    - **Deprecation budget** — no more than 10 symbols in deprecated state at once.
  - `docs/maintenance-checklist.md` (new): per-release preparation checklist (10 sections, 30 items) operationalising the policy; includes a hotfix fast-path for P0 regressions.
  - Link added to `README.md` Further Reading table.
- 0 new tests (5,593 total). Coverage: 97.06%/88.06%/95.83%/97.06%. Build: clean.

---

## [0.1.68] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **PM-9 — Core Guarantees Technical Paper (complete):**
  - `docs/core-guarantees.md` (new): concise, self-contained reference covering Ananke's full guarantee surface:
    1. **Fixed-point determinism** — the guarantee, how it is enforced (integer arithmetic, no `Math.random()`, insertion-order iteration, corpus hash CI), and what can break it.
    2. **API stability tiers** — what "breaking" means for Tier 1, the pre-1.0 note, and the deprecation lifecycle.
    3. **Schema and wire contracts** — world-state hash, replay format, content-pack checksum, semver range enforcement.
    4. **Validation philosophy** — three claim types: Empirical (source-bounded), Plausibility (first-principles), and Content-layer (definitional).
    5. **Benchmark methodology** — what the numbers mean and do not mean; how to detect correctness vs. performance regressions.
    6. **Known limits** — floating-point interop boundary, JS engine version portability, host clock independence, entity count scalability, numerical overflow handling.
  - Each claim is labelled **Engineering claim**, **Empirical claim**, or **Design principle**.
  - Links added to `README.md` Further Reading table and `STABLE_API.md` intro.
- 0 new tests (5,593 total). Coverage: 97.06%/88.06%/95.83%/97.06%. Build: clean.

---

## [0.1.67] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **PM-8 — Scenario Corpus as Shared Benchmark and Pedagogy Asset (complete):**
  - `corpus/` directory with 5 canonical deterministic scenarios, each carrying a `corpus.json` manifest (`version`, `id`, `title`, `tags`, `stabilityStatus`, `scenario`, `expectedOutputHash`, `performanceClass`, `replayFixture`, `bridgeExpected`).
  - Tags: `tutorial`, `benchmark`, `validation`, `networking`, `bridge`, `content-pack`.
  - Entries: `basic-duel` (tutorial, 30 ticks), `armoured-combat` (validation+content-pack, 50 ticks), `lockstep-replay` (networking, 10 ticks + replay.json fixture), `bridge-snapshot` (bridge, 0 ticks), `ai-benchmark` (benchmark, 20 ticks).
  - `tools/generate-corpus.ts`: regenerates all corpus entries from scenario definitions; computes world-state hashes, replay fixtures, and bridge-frame invariants. Run after any change to `stepWorld`, `hashWorldState`, or equipment constants.
  - `tools/verify-corpus.ts`: verifies all corpus entries against the live engine; checks world-state hash, replay parity (networking), and bridge frame shape (bridge). Supports `--id=<entry>` and `--json` flags.
  - npm scripts: `generate-corpus`, `verify-corpus`.
  - `corpus` added to `package.json` `files` array (shipped with the npm package).
  - Links added to README "Further Reading" table and `docs/cookbook.md` "Further reading" table.
- 0 new tests (5,593 total). Coverage: 97.11%/88.07%/95.83%/97.11%. Build: clean.

---

## [0.1.66] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **PM-7 — API Deprecation Framework (complete):**
  - `tools/audit-deprecations.ts` (new): scans all `src/` TypeScript files for `@deprecated` JSDoc tags and outputs a structured table of `{ symbol, file, line, since, removeAfter, replacement, overdue }`.
    - `--json` flag: machine-readable JSON output with timestamp, engine version, and full entry list.
    - `--check` flag: exits 1 if any symbol's `removeAfter` version ≤ current engine version (overdue).
  - `prepublishOnly` now includes `npm run audit-deprecations -- --check`: `npm publish` fails if any symbol is overdue for removal.
  - npm script: `audit-deprecations`.
  - Structured `@deprecated` convention defined: `@deprecated since {version} — use {replacement} instead. Removes at {removeAfter}.`
  - All three existing `@deprecated` tags in `src/` updated to the new structured format:
    - `anankeVersion` in `content-pack.ts`: since 0.1.65, removes at 0.3.0
    - `Perception` type alias in `sim/ai/perception.ts`: since 0.1.0, removes at 0.3.0
    - `mkWorld(seed, loadout)` overload in `sim/testing.ts`: since 0.1.0, removes at 0.2.0
  - `docs/versioning.md`: new "Deprecation lifecycle" section documenting the three-phase pattern (mark → migration window → remove), the required tag format, and the audit checklist.
  - `docs/module-index.md`: new "Deprecated exports" table surfacing all known deprecated symbols with since/removeAfter/replacement.
- 0 new tests (5,593 total). Coverage: 97.11%/88.07%/95.83%/97.11%. Build: clean.

### Deprecated

- `AnankePackManifest.anankeVersion` — since 0.1.65, use `registry.compatRange` instead. Removes at 0.3.0.

---

## [0.1.65] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **PM-6 — Content-Pack Registry Format (complete):**
  - `PackRegistryMeta` interface (new): optional `registry` block in `AnankePackManifest` with fields:
    - `compatRange` (string): semver range enforced at runtime by `validatePack` — rejects packs incompatible with the running engine version.
    - `stabilityTier` (`"stable"` | `"experimental"` | `"internal"`): controls listing in a public registry.
    - `requiredExports` (string[]): subpath exports the pack's content depends on — informational.
    - `checksum` (string): SHA-256 hex digest of the pack JSON — computed by `npx ananke pack bundle`, verified by the host.
    - `license` (string): SPDX identifier.
    - `provenance` (object[]): dataset / paper references for empirically grounded content.
  - `PackStabilityTier` and `PackProvenanceRef` types (new, exported from `"./content-pack"`).
  - `ANANKE_ENGINE_VERSION = "0.1.65"` constant (new, exported from `"./content-pack"`): current engine version used in `compatRange` evaluation.
  - `semverSatisfies(version, range)` (new, exported): lightweight semver range evaluator — supports `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `=`, `^` (caret), `~` (tilde), bare version, and compound space-separated ranges. No external dependencies.
  - `validatePack` extended to validate all registry sub-fields and reject incompatible `compatRange`.
  - `tools/pack-cli.ts` `bundle` command: automatically computes SHA-256 checksum and embeds it in `registry.checksum` before writing the bundle.
  - `schema/pack.schema.json`: `registry` block with full JSON Schema definition for all sub-fields.
  - `docs/pack-registry-spec.md` (new): full specification — field reference, checksum algorithm, runtime enforcement table, future online registry design.
- 24 new tests (5,593 total). Coverage: 97.11%/88.07%/95.83%/97.11%. Build: clean.

---

## [0.1.64] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **PM-5 — Deterministic Conformance Suite (complete):**
  - `conformance/` directory (published in package): 5 self-contained JSON fixture files that any third-party host SDK can use to verify deterministic compatibility with the reference TypeScript engine.
    - `state-hash.json`: given a canonical `WorldState`, `hashWorldState` must return specific hex values at tick 0 and tick 1.
    - `replay-parity.json`: re-simulating a recorded 10-tick replay with `replayTo` must reproduce the per-tick hash trace exactly. Uses `noMove` commands to avoid AI-state side-effect divergence.
    - `command-round-trip.json`: verifies `SCALE` constants and `CommandMap` JSON serialisation round-trips without loss for all 4 command kinds.
    - `bridge-snapshot.json`: `serializeBridgeFrame` must produce a `BridgeFrame` with the correct schema, tick, entity count, and entity IDs.
    - `lockstep-sequence.json`: stepping the simulation 20 ticks with `lineInfantry` AI must produce matching entity positions, dead flags, shock values, and world-state hashes at each tick.
  - `tools/generate-conformance-fixtures.ts`: reference fixture generator; run `npm run generate-conformance-fixtures` to regenerate after changes to the hash algorithm, `stepWorld`, or `serializeBridgeFrame`.
  - `tools/conformance-runner.ts`: standalone runner with `--json` (machine-readable) and `--fixture=<kind>` (single fixture) flags; exits 0 on all-pass, 1 on any failure.
  - `src/conformance.ts` (new subpath export `"./conformance"`): public TypeScript types for third-party runners — `FixtureKind`, `ConformanceFixtureHeader`, `StateHashFixture`, `ReplayParityFixture`, `CommandRoundTripFixture`, `BridgeSnapshotFixture`, `LockstepSequenceFixture`, `ConformanceResult`, `ConformanceSummary`, and `CONFORMANCE_VERSION`.
  - npm scripts: `generate-conformance-fixtures`, `conformance-runner`.
- 0 new tests (5,569 total). Coverage: 97.11%/88.08%/95.82%/97.11%. Build: clean.

## [0.1.63] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **PM-4 — Release Discipline Dashboard (complete):**
  - `tools/release-check.ts` (new): pre-release gate runner that executes 6 gates in sequence and produces two output artefacts:
    1. **Schema migration pass** — runs `test/schema-migration.test.ts` + `test/anatomy_schema.test.ts` via Vitest
    2. **Golden replay / fixture round-trip** — skips gracefully if `test/fixtures/` does not exist; runs fixture tests when present
    3. **Bridge contract type-check** — `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.build.json`; counts TypeScript errors
    4. **Benchmark regression** — delegates to `dist/tools/benchmark-check.js`; exit-code based
    5. **Emergent behaviour validation** — runs emergent-validation and parses PASS / PARTIAL PASS / FAIL from stdout
    6. **Module-index freshness** — re-generates `docs/module-index.md` and diffs against the committed version; warns if stale
  - `docs/release-report.json` (auto-generated): structured JSON with timestamp, version, per-gate status, duration, summary, and detail strings.
  - `docs/release-dashboard.md` (auto-generated): human-readable Markdown audit trail rendered from the JSON report. Includes verdict, gate table, and per-gate detail blocks.
  - `--quick` flag: skips slow gates (benchmark, emergent validation) for fast local checks.
  - Exit code: 0 = releasable (no failures, no warnings); 1 = not releasable.
  - npm scripts: `release-check`, `release-check:quick`.
- 0 new tests (5,569 total). Coverage unchanged. Build: clean.

---

## [0.1.62] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **PM-3 — Supported-Recipes Matrix (complete):**
  - `docs/recipes-matrix.md` (new, auto-generated): 36 recipes across 6 domains (Tactical ⚔️, Campaign 🏰, Content 📦, Renderer 🖼️, Multiplayer 🌐, Tooling 🔧). Each row maps a use case to recommended packages, stability tier (🟢 Stable / 🟡 Experimental), runnable npm script, performance envelope, and save/replay compatibility status. Domain tables, summary counts, and a quick-reference "I want to…" table at the bottom.
  - `tools/generate-recipes-matrix.ts` (new): structured recipe catalogue as TypeScript array; outputs `docs/recipes-matrix.md` deterministically. Run `npm run generate-recipes-matrix` to refresh.
  - `npm run generate-recipes-matrix` script added.
  - README: "Not sure which entry point to use? → Recipes Matrix" note added near the cookbook paragraph; matrix linked first in the Further Reading table.
- 0 new tests (5,569 total). Coverage unchanged. Build: clean.

---

## [0.1.61] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **PM-2 — Package-Boundary Enforcement in CI (complete):**
  - `tools/check-package-boundaries.ts` (new): static import-graph analyser mapping all 207 src/ files to their planned `@ananke/*` package. Reports:
    - **Hard violations** — files classified as `@ananke/core` that import from `@ananke/combat`, `@ananke/campaign`, or `@ananke/content` (86 identified; all expected in Phase 1 monolith, must be resolved in Phase 2 source migration).
    - **Suspicious cross-boundary imports** — peer-layer imports (`combat↔campaign`, `combat↔content`, `content↔campaign`) grouped by edge with file:line references and example paths.
    - **Cross-package import matrix** — NxN table showing import counts between packages, annotated ✓ (allowed) or ✗ (violation).
    - **Source size estimate** — raw TypeScript byte counts per package (core 341 KB, combat 499 KB, campaign 833 KB, content 248 KB).
    - **Unmapped files** — 9 files not yet in the mapping (atmosphere, battle-bridge, debug, host-loop, index, parallel, sensory, terrain-bridge).
    - Flags: `--strict` (exit 1 on hard violations), `--json` (machine-readable output).
  - `tools/extract-api.ts` (new): public API surface extraction — scans each package's entry-point source files for exported symbols, generates `docs/api-surface-<package>.md` with grouped tables (types/interfaces, enums, functions, constants, classes) and a source-file index.
    - `docs/api-surface-core.md` — 125 exports
    - `docs/api-surface-combat.md` — 221 exports
    - `docs/api-surface-campaign.md` — 691 exports
    - `docs/api-surface-content.md` — 103 exports (1140 total)
  - `"ci"` script now runs `check-boundaries` after test coverage, making cross-boundary drift visible in CI output.
  - npm scripts: `check-boundaries`, `check-boundaries:strict`, `extract-api`.
- 0 new tests (5,569 total — tools only). Coverage unchanged: 97.11% stmt, 88.08% branch, 95.82% func. Build: clean.

### Added

- **PM-1 — First-Party Reference Builds (complete):**
  - `examples/reference/tactical-duel/` — end-to-end tactical demonstration: combat, anatomy, AI, `serializeBridgeFrame`, `hashWorldState`, `ReplayRecorder`. Runs in < 1 ms/tick; produces a replay file comparable with `npx ananke replay diff`. Includes architecture doc and pain-points guide.
  - `examples/reference/campaign-sandbox/` — turn-based world simulation: four polities (Rome, Carthage, Athens, Sparta) with trade, alliances, population dynamics, plague outbreak, inter-polity spread, save/reload via `stampSnapshot`. Runs in < 1 ms/day. Includes full `README.md` with correct API signatures.
  - `examples/reference/species-lab/` — xenobiology lab: attribute profiles for 6 species (Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Goblin, Troll, Halfling), extended-senses predicates, round-robin combat tournament (100 seeds × 15 matchups) with outcome distributions and physics insights. Quick mode (`--quick`) completes 150 trials in < 1 s. Includes pain-points guide and extension examples.
  - Each reference build includes: architecture diagram, package choices rationale, measured performance envelope, pain points encountered and resolved, extension examples.
  - npm scripts: `ref:tactical-duel`, `ref:campaign-sandbox`, `ref:species-lab`, `ref:species-lab:quick`.
  - ROADMAP: PM-1 through PM-10 added (Platform Maturity Roadmap); PA-1, PA-5–PA-8 marked complete.

  - `"./netcode"` subpath export added to `package.json`.
  - **`ananke replay diff` CLI subcommand**: extends the `npx ananke` CLI — reads two replay JSON files and prints the first divergence tick and hex hashes, or confirms they are identical. Exit code 0 = identical; exit code 1 = divergence.
  - **`docs/netcode-host-checklist.md`** (new): 8-section guide covering fixed tick rate, no wall-clock reads in simulation path, input serialisation format, desync detection, state resync (full snapshot), replay recording and diff, rollback implementation outline, and KernelContext consistency requirements.
  - **`examples/lockstep-server.ts`** (new): self-contained authoritative lockstep demo — one server steps the world, two virtual clients verify hash checksums every tick. Demonstrates replay recording and `serializeBridgeFrame` integration.
  - **`examples/rollback-client.ts`** (new): rollback demo — client predicts speculatively, reconciles against server hash, and re-simulates from the last confirmed snapshot when a mismatch is detected.
  - npm scripts: `example:lockstep`, `example:rollback`.
- 16 new tests (189 test files, 5,569 tests total). Coverage: 97.11% stmt, 88.07% branch, 95.82% func. `netcode.ts`: 100%/100%/100%. Build: clean.

## [0.1.57] — 2026-03-30

### Added

- **PA-8 — Host Integration SDKs (complete):**
  - `src/host-loop.ts` (new): stable, versioned wire-format protocol for the Ananke sidecar ↔ renderer bridge. All values on the wire are real SI units (floats, not fixed-point).
    - **Wire types**: `BridgeVec3`, `BridgeCondition`, `BridgeAnimation`, `BridgePoseModifier`, `BridgeGrappleConstraint`, `BridgeEntitySnapshot`, `BridgeFrame`, `HostLoopConfig`.
    - **`serializeBridgeFrame(world, config)`**: canonical serializer — converts `WorldState` to `BridgeFrame`. Replaces per-sidecar serializer duplications in Unity and Godot reference implementations.
    - **`derivePrimaryState(animation)`**: maps `AnimationHints` to a single state string (`"idle"` | `"attack"` | `"flee"` | `"prone"` | `"unconscious"` | `"dead"`). Suitable for top-level renderer state machines.
    - **`derivePoseOffset(segmentId, impairmentQ)`**: anatomical local-space bone offset at a given impairment level (real metres), for injury deformation blend shapes.
    - Constants: `BRIDGE_SCHEMA_VERSION = "ananke.bridge.frame.v1"`, `DEFAULT_TICK_HZ = 20`, `DEFAULT_BRIDGE_PORT = 3001`, `DEFAULT_BRIDGE_HOST`, `DEFAULT_STREAM_PATH`.
  - `"./host-loop"` subpath export added to `package.json`.
  - **Reference sidecar updates**: both `ananke-unity-reference` and `ananke-godot-reference` sidecars updated to v0.1.57 dependency and refactored to import `serializeBridgeFrame` from `@its-not-rocket-science/ananke/host-loop` — local serialization code removed.
  - **Quickstart guides** (new):
    - `docs/quickstart-unity.md`: 15-minute Unity integration guide (sidecar → WebSocket → `AnankeReceiver` → `AnimationDriver` → your mesh).
    - `docs/quickstart-godot.md`: 15-minute Godot 4 integration guide (GDScript and C# addon variants).
    - `docs/quickstart-web.md`: Three.js browser integration guide (zero-build-step HTML example + `serializeBridgeFrame` sidecar recipe).
- 41 new tests (188 test files, 5,553 tests total). Coverage: 97.10% stmt, 88.05% branch, 95.81% func. Build: clean.

---

## [0.1.56] — 2026-03-30

### Added

- **PA-7 — Advanced Non-Visual Sensory Systems (complete):**
  - `src/sim/sensory-extended.ts`: added `thermalVisionRange_m?: number` to `ExtendedSenses` interface — fourth modality alongside echolocation, electroreception, and olfaction. Effective range scales with target thermal signature; degraded by precipitation; dead entities have no thermal signature.
  - `src/extended-senses.ts` (new): unified extended-senses module with `AtmosphericState` integration (PA-6).
    - Body-plan predicates: `hasEcholocation`, `hasElectroreception`, `hasThermalVision`, `hasOlfaction`, `dominantSense` (priority: electroreception > echolocation > thermal > olfaction > vision).
    - `thermalSignature(entity)` → Q: dead=q(0); living=base q(0.30) + q(0.10) per bleeding region + q(0.15) if shock≥q(0.40).
    - `canDetectByThermalVision(observer, subject, dist_m, precipIntensity?)`: effective range = baseRange × signature / SCALE.Q × (1 − precipIntensity × 0.60). Detection quality `DETECT_THERMAL = q(0.35)`.
    - `canDetectExtendedAtmospheric(observer, subject, env, atmospheric, sensorBoost?)`: drop-in replacement for Phase 52 `canDetectExtended` that uses `AtmosphericState.scentStrength_Q` from `queryAtmosphericModifiers` for olfaction, and `precipIntensity_Q` for thermal attenuation.
    - `stepExtendedSenses(observer, world, atmospheric, env)` → `ExtendedSensesResult { detections }`: per-tick batch detection accumulator; iterates all world entities, checks all four extended modalities, returns `SensoryDetection[]` with `entityId`, `modality`, `quality_Q`, `dist_Sm`. Multiple detections per target are possible.
  - Exports: `SenseModality`, `SensoryDetection`, `ExtendedSensesResult`, `THERMAL_BASE_SIGNATURE_Q`, `THERMAL_BLEED_BONUS_Q`, `THERMAL_SHOCK_BONUS_Q`, `THERMAL_SHOCK_THRESHOLD`, `THERMAL_PRECIP_PENALTY`, `DETECT_THERMAL`, `DETECT_OLFACTION_ATMO_MIN`, `DETECT_OLFACTION_ATMO_MAX`.
  - `"./extended-senses"` subpath export added to `package.json`.
- 60 new tests (187 test files, 5,512 tests total). Build: clean.

## [0.1.55] — 2026-03-30

### Added

- **PA-6 — Unified Atmosphere Model (complete):**
  - `src/atmosphere.ts` (new): single `AtmosphericState` struct derived from Phase 51 `WeatherState` and Phase 68 `BiomeContext`, with a unified per-pair query API.
  - `deriveAtmosphericState(weather?, biome?)` → `AtmosphericState`: maps WeatherState wind to 3D `AtmosphericWind` (adds `dz_m`, derives `turbulence_Q` from speed); derives `precipIntensity_Q` from precipitation type; computes `baseVisibility_Sm` from fog × precipitation; computes `acousticMask_Q` from wind noise; maps biome `soundPropagation_Q` (vacuum = 0, water = 4×, standard air = 1×); derives `tractionMod_Q` and `thermalOffset_Q` from `deriveWeatherModifiers`.
  - `queryAtmosphericModifiers(from, to, state)` → `AtmosphericModifiers`: single call yields all position-pair atmospheric effects — `crossWindSpeed_mps` (perpendicular wind for projectile drift), `hazardConeMul_Q` (gas/smoke cone range 0.5×–1.5× from headwind/tailwind), `acousticMaskMul_Q` (hearing range including upwind bonus and biome propagation), `visibilityRange_Sm` (headwind-boosted precipitation degradation), `tractionMod_Q`, `scentStrength_Q` (q(1.0) fully downwind of target, q(0) upwind — prerequisite for PA-7), `thermalOffset_Q`.
  - `"./atmosphere"` subpath export added to `package.json`.

## [0.1.54] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- **PA-5 — Campaign ↔ Tactical Terrain Bridge (complete):**
  - `src/terrain-bridge.ts` (new): maps campaign hex tiles to tactical battlefield parameters consumable by `KernelContext`, and merges tactical battle results back into `CampaignState`.
  - `extractTerrainParams(hexType)` → deterministic 10×8-cell (100 m × 80 m) battlefield with `TerrainGrid`, `ObstacleGrid`, `ElevationGrid`, `SlopeGrid`, and `CoverSegment[]` for all 8 hex types: `plains`, `forest`, `hills`, `marsh`, `urban`, `mountain`, `river_crossing`, `coastal`.
  - `generateBattleSite(ctx)` → full `BattleTerrainParams` including `EntryVector[]` — attacker/defender spawn positions (y=5 m south, y=75 m north) with `facingY` direction.
  - `mergeBattleOutcome(campaign, outcome)` → merges post-battle `WorldState` into `CampaignState`: removes `injury.dead` entities, copies post-battle `injury`/`condition` onto survivors, transfers looted weapons/items from captured entities to winner's inventory, advances `worldTime_s`, appends a log entry.
  - Exports: `CampaignHexType`, `EntryVector`, `BattleTerrainParams`, `BattleSiteContext`, `BattleOutcome`; field constants `FIELD_WIDTH_Sm`, `FIELD_HEIGHT_Sm`, `CELL_SIZE_Sm`, `GRID_COLS`, `GRID_ROWS`.

### Added

- **PA-4 — Scenario & Content Pack System (complete):**
  - `src/content-pack.ts` (new): runtime `.ananke-pack` loader — `validatePack`, `loadPack`, `getPackScenario`, `instantiatePackScenario`, `listLoadedPacks`, `getLoadedPack`, `clearPackRegistry`. `loadPack` registers weapons/armour/archetypes into the global catalog AND into the world-factory extension tables so they are immediately usable in `loadScenario` scenarios.
  - `src/world-factory.ts`: added `registerWorldArchetype`, `registerWorldItem`, `clearWorldExtensions` extension hooks so content packs can make their items available to `createWorld` / `loadScenario` without a source build.
  - `schema/pack.schema.json` (new): JSON Schema 2020-12 for pack manifests (weapons, armour, archetypes, scenarios sections; full per-field documentation).
  - `tools/pack-cli.ts` (new): `ananke pack validate <file>`, `ananke pack bundle <dir>`, `ananke pack load <file>`. Registered as `bin.ananke` in `package.json` so `npx ananke pack validate` works after install.
  - `examples/packs/weapons-medieval.json`: 5 medieval weapons + 3 armours.
  - `examples/packs/species-humanoids.json`: 4 humanoid archetype variants.
  - `examples/packs/scenarios-duel.json`: 3 duel scenarios, self-contained with own archetypes and weapons.
  - `"./content-pack"` subpath, `schema/pack.schema.json`, and `bin.ananke` added to `package.json`.
- 32 new tests (184 test files, 5,332 tests total). Build: clean.

### Added

- **PA-3 — Stable Schema, Save & Wire Contract (complete):**
  - `src/schema-migration.ts` (new): schema versioning and migration utilities — `SCHEMA_VERSION`, `stampSnapshot`, `validateSnapshot` (returns `ValidationError[]` with JSONPath paths), `migrateWorld` (chains registered migrations; legacy saves treated as version `"0.0"`), `registerMigration`, `detectVersion`, `isValidSnapshot`.
  - `schema/world.schema.json` (new): JSON Schema 2020-12 for `WorldState` — documents `@core` fields (`tick`, `seed`, `entities` with per-entity validation), `@subsystem` fields, and Q-value semantics.
  - `schema/replay.schema.json` (new): JSON Schema 2020-12 for `Replay` / `ReplayFrame` / `Command`.
  - `docs/wire-protocol.md` (new): Q-value serialisation rules (store raw integers, never divide by `SCALE.Q`), binary diff format (ANKD magic, tag-value encoding), multiplayer lockstep message types (`cmd`/`ack`/`resync`/`hash_mismatch`), save-format recommendations, and full load-with-migration code sample.
  - `"./schema"` subpath added to `package.json` exports.
  - `schema/` directory and `docs/wire-protocol.md` added to `package.json` `"files"`.
- 39 new tests (183 test files, 5,300 tests total). Build: clean.

  - `packages/combat/` — `@ananke/combat` stub; re-exports `"./combat"`, `"./anatomy"`, `"./competence"`, `"./wasm-kernel"`.
  - `packages/campaign/` — `@ananke/campaign` stub; re-exports all 32 campaign-scale subpaths (polity, social, narrative, feudal, demography, economy, military…).
  - `packages/content/` — `@ananke/content` stub; re-exports `"./species"`, `"./catalog"`, `"./character"`, `"./crafting"`.
  - Each stub ships a pre-built `index.js` + `index.d.ts` (no separate compilation step); `@its-not-rocket-science/ananke` is a peer dependency.
  - Root `package.json` gains `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` for local linking.
  - `docs/package-architecture.md` (new): canonical package boundary design — dependency graph, monolith subpath → package mapping table, full source-file → package mapping for Phase 2 migration, and a before/after import example.
  - `docs/migration-monolith-to-modular.md` (new): step-by-step migration guide from the monolith to `@ananke/*` packages, with a complete old-import → new-package lookup table and Phase 2 expectations.
  - `docs/package-architecture.md` and `docs/migration-monolith-to-modular.md` added to `package.json` `"files"` so they ship with the published package.
- Build: clean. Tests: 5,261 passing. Coverage unchanged.

  - `docs/module-index.md` (new): Machine-checkable table of all 41 package subpath exports, with stability tier (Tier 1 Stable / Tier 2 Experimental / Tier 3 Campaign-scale), key exports, use-case notes, and doc links. Includes use-case entry-point guide at the top.
  - `tools/generate-module-index.ts` (new): Script that reads `package.json` exports and renders `docs/module-index.md`. Added `generate-module-index` npm script.
  - `docs/integration-primer.md`: Added "Choose Your Entry Point" section before Architecture Overview, with use-case decision tree and module tier table linking to `docs/module-index.md`.
  - `README.md`: Added `docs/module-index.md` row to Further Reading table.
- Build: clean. Tests: 5,261 passing. Coverage: statements 97.1 %, branches 87.83 %, functions 95.65 %, lines 97.1 %.

## [0.1.49] — 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **Crafting subsystem — remaining TODO/placeholder items resolved:**
  - `src/crafting/manufacturing.ts` — `createAssemblySteps`: now derives skill types and tool categories from the recipe's actual `skillRequirements` and `toolRequirements` instead of hardcoded `"forge"`/alternating BK–LM defaults.
  - Removed misleading "placeholder" and outdated "Phase 24 placeholder" comments from `recipes.ts`, `crafting/index.ts`, and `dialogue.ts`; documentation now accurately reflects current behaviour.

### Docs

- **ROADMAP — Platformization & Adoption Roadmap (2026–2027):** Added a new top-level section following external review batch 4, which concluded that the simulation kernel is feature-complete and the next phase should focus on adoption, composability, and contract stability rather than new subsystems. Ten new roadmap items added (PA-1 through PA-10): documentation reconciliation & architecture map, modular package architecture (`@ananke/core`, `@ananke/combat`, etc.), stable schema/save/wire contract, scenario & content pack system, campaign ↔ tactical terrain bridge, unified atmosphere model, advanced non-visual sensory systems, host integration SDKs (Unity / Godot / Unreal / Web), simulation cookbook, and deterministic networking kit.
- Build: clean. Tests: 5,261 passing. Coverage: statements 97.1 %, branches 87.83 %, functions 95.65 %, lines 97.1 %.

## [0.1.48] — 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **Crafting subsystem — TODO/placeholder items resolved:**
  - `src/crafting/materials.ts` — `createMaterialItem`: corrected `mass_kg` (was double-scaled by `SCALE.kg`; now `quantity_kg * SCALE.kg / SCALE.Q`); `bulk` now computed proportionally from quantity instead of a fixed `q(1.0)` placeholder.
  - `src/inventory.ts` — `findMaterialsByType`: replaced loose `templateId.includes(materialTypeId)` with exact `templateId === "material_" + materialTypeId` to prevent false positives (e.g. "iron" matching "iron_ore").
  - `src/crafting/manufacturing.ts` — `ProductionLine` gains optional `workshopTimeReduction_Q` and `workshopQualityBonus_Q` fields; `setupProductionLine` now looks up the recipe and calls `getWorkshopBonus` to populate them; `advanceProduction` applies the time reduction to effective progress; `calculateBatchQualityRange` accepts an optional `workshopQualityBonus_Q` multiplier; `estimateBatchCompletionTime` accepts an optional `workshopTimeReduction_Q` and its formula is corrected (was dividing by SCALE.Q twice, producing near-zero results).
  - `src/crafting/workshops.ts` — `upgradeWorkshop`: now checks that `resources` contains sufficient `material_wood` (10 units per tier step) before upgrading; returns `success: false` when insufficient rather than always succeeding.
  - `src/crafting/index.ts` — `startManufacturing`: now returns the constructed `ProductionLine` in `result.productionLine` so callers can store it for subsequent `advanceManufacturing` calls (persistent state remains the host's responsibility); `advanceManufacturing` now derives quality range and time reduction from the supplied `workshop` rather than using hardcoded values.
- Build: clean. Tests: 5,261 passing. Coverage: statements 97.1 %, branches 87.83 %, functions 95.65 %, lines 97.1 %.

  - Removed unused imports and prefixed unused locals with `_` across 50+ test files
  - Fixed `getAvailableMaterials` TODO in `src/crafting/materials.ts` — now accepts `readonly Material[]` and derives per-type totals
  - Removed `@ts-nocheck` from `as/injury.ts`; applied `const` fixes and removed dead imports throughout `src/`
- **UK English** — updated all comments, JSDoc, and documentation prose to British spelling (`armour`, `defence`, `behaviour`, `analyse`, `calibre`, `colour`); exported API identifiers unchanged
- Build: clean. Tests: 5,261 passing. Coverage: statements 97.12 %, branches 87.87 %, functions 95.65 %, lines 97.12 %.

## [0.1.23] — 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Phase 78 · Seasonal Calendar & Agricultural Cycle** (`src/calendar.ts`)

  - `resolveSuccession(lineage, deceasedId, renownRegistry, rule, worldSeed, tick)` → `SuccessionResult`:
    - **primogeniture**: first-born child (lowest entityId) gets SCALE.Q claim; others by distance.
    - **renown_based**: claim = 70% own renown + 30% inherited renown.
    - **election**: renown-weighted deterministic lottery via `eventSeed`.
    - Stability: `+STABILITY_CLEAN_SUCCESSION_Q` for uncontested direct heir; `−STABILITY_DISTANT_HEIR_Q` per extra degree; `−STABILITY_CONTESTED_Q` when top-two gap < q(0.10); `−STABILITY_NO_HEIR_Q` if no candidates.

## [0.1.21] — 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Phase 76 · Kinship & Lineage** (`src/kinship.ts`)
  - `LineageNode { entityId, parentIds, childIds, partnerIds }` — family links per entity.
  - `LineageRegistry { nodes: Map<number, LineageNode> }` — flat registry, no Entity field changes.
  - `createLineageRegistry()` / `getLineageNode(registry, entityId)` — factory and lazy-init accessor.

---

## [0.1.20] — 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Phase 75 · Entity Renown & Legend Registry** (`src/renown.ts`)
  - `RenownRecord { entityId, renown_Q, infamy_Q, entries: LegendEntry[] }` — per-entity reputation on two orthogonal axes.
  - `LegendEntry { entryId, tick, eventType, significance }` — lightweight reference to a significant `ChronicleEntry`.
  - `RenownRegistry { records: Map<number, RenownRecord> }` — flat registry, one record per entity.
  - `createRenownRegistry()` / `getRenownRecord(registry, entityId)` — factory and lazy-init accessor.
  - `updateRenownFromChronicle(registry, chronicle, entityId, minSignificance?)` — idempotent scan; renown events (legendary_deed, quest_completed, combat_victory, masterwork_crafted, rank_promotion, settlement_founded, first_contact) add to `renown_Q`; infamy events (relationship_betrayal, settlement_raided, settlement_destroyed, quest_failed) add to `infamy_Q`; both capped at SCALE.Q.

  - 42 new tests; 4,079 total. Coverage maintained above all thresholds.

---

## [0.1.19] — 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Phase 74 · Simulation Trace → Narrative Prose** (`src/narrative-prose.ts`)
  - 6 prose tones: `neutral | heroic | tragic | martial | spiritual | mercantile`
  - Tone-varied templates for all 19 `ChronicleEventType` values.
  - `deriveNarrativeTone(culture)` — maps dominant `CultureProfile` value → `ProseTone`
    via `VALUE_TONE_MAP` (martial_virtue→martial, spiritual_devotion→spiritual,
    commerce→mercantile, honour→heroic, fatalism→tragic; others fall back to neutral).
  - `mythArchetypeFrame(archetype)` — returns a culturally-flavoured closing phrase for
    each `MythArchetype` (hero, monster, trickster, great_plague, divine_wrath, golden_age).
  - `createNarrativeContext(entityNames, culture?, myth?)` — bundles tone + name map + myth frame.
  - `renderEntryWithTone(entry, ctx)` — picks the tone variant for each event, substitutes
    `{name}`, `{target}`, computed helper strings (`{cause_str}`, `{location_str}`, etc.),
    raw `entry.variables`, and appends the myth frame (replacing terminal period).
  - `renderChronicleWithTone(chronicle, ctx, minSignificance?)` — filters by significance,
    sorts chronologically, maps via `renderEntryWithTone`.
  - **Success criterion met:** martial, spiritual, and mercantile tones produce clearly
    distinguishable prose from the same chronicle events.
  - 39 new tests; 4,037 total. Coverage: statements 96.81%, branches 86.87%, functions 94.80%.

---

## [0.1.18] — 2026-03-26

### Added

- **CE-18 · External Agent Interface** (`tools/agent-server.ts`)
  - WebSocket server (default port 3001) implementing an agent observation/action loop
    over the existing `stepWorld` kernel — no src/ changes, no new npm exports.
  - **Protocol:**
    - Client → `{ type: "step", commands?: AgentCommand[] }` or `{ type: "reset" }`
    - Server → `{ type: "obs", tick, entities: ObservationSlice[], done, winner? }`
    - On connect → `{ type: "init", config, obs }`
  - **`ObservationSlice`** — safe subset: position, velocity, fatigue, shock/consciousness/dead,
    detected nearby enemies (filtered via Phase 52 `canDetect`). No raw internals exposed.
  - **`AgentCommand`** — validated high-level actions: `attack | move | dodge | flee | idle`.
    Invalid team targeting silently dropped; `decideCommandsForEntity` fills in missing commands.
  - Configurable scenario: `TEAM1_SIZE` / `TEAM2_SIZE` (1–4 each), `SEED`, `MAX_TICKS` via env vars.
    Default: 1v1, Knight (longsword + mail) vs Brawler (club).
  - Agent-driven stepping: server advances only when client sends `step` — agent controls tick rate.
  - Determinism preserved: external commands injected via existing `CommandMap` before `stepWorld`.
  - HTTP endpoints: `GET /config`, `GET /status`, `POST /reset`.
  - Run: `npm run agent-server`
  - **Success criterion met:** An external Python script using only `websockets` can drive a single
    entity through a 1v1 fight, receiving `ObservationSlice` observations each tick and submitting
    `attack` / `move` commands, without importing any Ananke TypeScript.

---

## [0.1.17] — 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Phase 73 · Enhanced Epidemiological Models** (`src/sim/disease.ts` extended in-place)
  - `VaccinationRecord { diseaseId, efficacy_Q, doseCount }` — partial-efficacy vaccination
    stored on `entity.vaccinations?`; `vaccinate(entity, diseaseId, efficacy_Q)` helper.
  - `ageSusceptibility_Q(ageYears)` — U-shaped multiplier: infants ×1.30, children ×0.80,
    adults ×1.00, early elderly ×1.20, late elderly ×1.50. Auto-applied in
    `computeTransmissionRisk` when `entity.age` is set.
  - `NPIType`, `NPIRecord`, `NPIRegistry` — non-pharmaceutical intervention registry;
    `applyNPI / removeNPI / hasNPI` helpers. `mask_mandate` reduces airborne transmission
    by `NPI_MASK_REDUCTION_Q = q(0.60)` (60 %). `quarantine` recorded for host-side pair
    filtering.
  - `computeTransmissionRisk` extended with optional 5th `options?` parameter — backward-
    compatible; applies vaccination, age susceptibility, and NPI effects when present.
  - `computeR0(profile, entityMap)` — basic reproductive number estimate
    (β × infectious-days × min(15, population−1)); used for validation.
  - `stepSEIR(entity, delta_s, profile, worldSeed, tick)` — SEIR-aware entity step that
    isolates a single disease profile; delegates to Phase 56 `stepDiseaseForEntity` for
    full backward compatibility.
  - `registerDiseaseProfile(profile)` — registers custom/SEIR profiles into the lookup map
    without modifying the canonical `DISEASE_PROFILES` array.
  - `MEASLES` profile (`useSeir: true`): R0 ≈ 15.1 in population ≥ 16, 14-day incubation,
    14-day infectious period, 0.2 % IFR, permanent immunity. Validates epidemic curve
    peaking days 10–20 and burning out by day 60 (matches standard SIR output ±15 %).
  - `entity.vaccinations?: VaccinationRecord[]` added to `Entity`.
  - `DiseaseProfile.useSeir?: boolean` opt-in field (no effect on existing callers).
  - 37 new tests in `test/disease-seir.test.ts`. All 37 Phase 56 tests pass unmodified.
  - **3 998 tests total.**

---

## [0.1.16] — 2026-03-25

### Added

- **CE-5 · Persistent World Server** — campaign ↔ combat battle bridge:
  - src/battle-bridge.ts: pure functions translating polity state to
    BattleConfig and BattleOutcome back to PolityImpact[]. Covers
    tech-era→loadout mapping, military-strength→team-size scaling,
    deterministic battle seed, morale/stability/population impact.
    27 tests in test/battle-bridge.test.ts.
  - tools/persistent-world.ts: integrated server running polity tick +
    synchronous tactical battles every 7 days per active war. Battle
    outcomes mutate polity morale, stability, and population. Full
    checkpoint/resume, WebSocket push, HTTP war/peace/save/reset/battles
    endpoints. Run with: npm run persistent-world

---

## [0.1.15] — 2026-03-25

### Added

- **CE-5 · WebAssembly Kernel** — shadow-mode WASM acceleration for push repulsion and
  injury accumulation:
  - `as/units.ts` — AssemblyScript port of `src/units.ts` (all 13 exports: SCALE constants,
    `q()`, `clampQ()`, `qMul()`, `qDiv()`, `mulDiv()`, `sqrtQ()`, `cbrtQ()`, unit
    converters).  Compiled to `dist/as/units.wasm`.
  - `as/push.ts` — pair-wise position repulsion kernel in flat WASM memory (64-entity
    capacity, octagonal distance approximation, overflow-safe i64 arithmetic).
    Compiled to `dist/as/push.wasm`.
  - `as/injury.ts` — per-entity injury accumulation inner loop (clotting, bleed→fluid,
    shock, consciousness, death check) matching `src/sim/step/injury.ts` constants exactly.
    Compiled to `dist/as/injury.wasm`.
  - `src/wasm-kernel.ts` — Node.js host bridge.  `WasmKernel.shadowStep(world, tick)`
    marshals entity state into WASM memory, runs both kernels, and returns a
    `WasmStepReport` with per-entity velocity deltas and projected vitals.  Shadow mode:
    outputs are never applied to world state — used for validation and diagnostics only.
  - `loadWasmKernel()` factory loads `push.wasm` + `injury.wasm` from `dist/as/` at
    runtime via `import.meta.url` + `readFileSync`.
  - Exported as `@its-not-rocket-science/ananke/wasm-kernel`.
  - `dist/as/` (compiled WASM binaries) included in the published package.
  - 61 WASM unit tests (`test/as/`) covering units, push repulsion, and injury
    accumulation parity with the TypeScript reference implementation.
  - Build scripts: `npm run build:wasm:all`, `npm run test:wasm`.

### Added

- **Phase 71 · Cultural Generation & Evolution Framework** (`src/culture.ts`)
  - Reverse WOAC method: derives culture bottom-up from five forces (`environment`,
    `power`, `exchange`, `legacy`, `belief`) scored from simulation state.
  - `generateCulture(polity, registry, myths, vassals?, biome?)` → `CultureProfile`
    with 10 possible `CulturalValue` types, `CulturalContradiction` pairs, and
    `CulturalCycle` practices (CYCLES audit).
  - `stepCultureYear(profile, techPressure_Q, militaryOutcome_Q, myths, worldSeed, tick)`
    → `CultureYearResult { profile, schism? }`: tech diffusion pulls exchange force
    upward; military outcomes shift power; new myths update legacy/belief; conservative
    cultures with high tension fire deterministic `SchismEvent` (reform_movement,
    heresy, or civil_unrest).
  - `describeCulture(profile)` → `{ summary, values, contradictions, cycles }`:
    human-readable output for writers and game designers.
  - Query helpers: `getCulturalValue`, `getDominantValues`, `getSignificantContradictions`.
  - Integrates with Phase 70 (vassal count → power force), Phase 66 (myths → legacy/belief),
    Phase 68 (BiomeContext → environment harshness), Phase 23 dialogue and Phase 24
    faction standing via exported profile queries.
  - 45 tests in `test/culture.test.ts`; exported via `ananke/campaign` subpath.

- **Phase 70 · Stratified Political Simulation ("Vassal Web" Layer)** (`src/polity-vassals.ts`)
  - `VassalNode` — intermediate layer between Entity and Polity with `territory_Q`,
    `military_Q`, `treasury_cu`, and a `VassalLoyalty` block.
  - Seven `LoyaltyType` variants with distinct `stepVassalLoyalty` dynamics:
    `ideological` (slow, conviction-driven), `transactional` (treasury comparison),
    `terrified` (instant collapse if liege appears weak), `honor_bound` (oath + grievance
    spike), `opportunistic` (tracks liege/rival morale ratio), `kin_bound` (stable family
    ties), `ideological_rival` (constant decay, cannot recover).
  - `applyGrievanceEvent` — immutable grievance accumulation (host applies broken-promise,
    tax-hike, kin-death events).
  - `computeVassalContribution` — loyalty-scaled troop and treasury output; zero below
    `CONTRIBUTION_FLOOR_Q` (q(0.20)), full above `CONTRIBUTION_FULL_Q` (q(0.50)).
  - `computeEffectiveMilitary` — sums contributions for command-chain filtering before
    passing force ratio to Phase 69 `resolveTacticalEngagement`.
  - `detectRebellionRisk` — Q score (70% low-loyalty + 30% high-grievance) for AI queries.
  - `resolveSuccessionCrisis` — deterministic heir-support rolls weighted by `military_Q`;
    winners gain +q(0.05) loyalty, losers −q(0.08); `SuccessionResult` with `supportQ`
    and per-vassal `loyaltyDeltas`.
  - 40 tests in `test/polity-vassals.test.ts`; exported via `ananke/campaign` subpath.

- **Option B · Tier 2 subpath exports** — eight new named import subpaths for all
  Tier 2 module groupings; deep imports remain supported as a fallback:
  - `ananke/character` → aging, sleep, disease, wound-aging, thermoregulation, nutrition,
    medical, toxicology, progression
  - `ananke/combat` → ranged, grapple, formation-combat, mount, hazard, morale, sensory,
    sensory-extended, weather, terrain, skills, biome
  - `ananke/campaign` → campaign, downtime, collective-activities, settlement,
    settlement-services, inventory, item-durability, world-generation, inheritance,
    economy, polity (campaign layer barrel)
  - `ananke/social` → dialogue, faction, relationships, relationships-effects, party,
    quest, quest-generators
  - `ananke/narrative` → chronicle, story-arcs, narrative-render, legend, mythology,
    narrative, narrative-stress, metrics, arena
  - `ananke/anatomy` → existing `src/anatomy/index.ts` barrel
  - `ananke/crafting` → existing `src/crafting/index.ts` barrel
  - `ananke/competence` → existing `src/competence/index.ts` barrel
  - `STABLE_API.md` updated to document preferred subpath import patterns.

- **CE-16 · Modding Support** (`src/modding.ts`)
  - Layer 1 — `hashMod(json)`: deterministic FNV-1a fingerprint (8-char hex) for any
    parsed JSON mod file; canonical key-sorted serialisation ensures order-independence.
  - Layer 2 — Post-tick behaviour hooks: `registerPostTickHook / unregisterPostTickHook /
    runPostTickHooks / listPostTickHooks / clearPostTickHooks`; hooks fire after
    `stepWorld`, are purely observational (logging, analytics, renderer updates).
  - Layer 3 — AI behaviour node registry: `registerBehaviorNode / unregisterBehaviorNode /
    getBehaviorNode / listBehaviorNodes / clearBehaviorNodes`; custom `BehaviorNode`
    factories registered by id for scenario and behaviour-tree composition.
  - Session fingerprint: `computeModManifest(catalogIds)` returns sorted id lists and a
    single fingerprint covering all three layers for multiplayer client validation.
  - `clearAllMods()` resets hooks and behaviour nodes (catalog unchanged).
  - 42 tests in `test/modding.test.ts`; exported via `src/index.ts`.

- **CE-14 · Socio-Economic Campaign Layer → Stable Promotion**
  - Promote `stepPolityDay`, `declareWar`, `makePeace`, `areAtWar`,
    `createPolity`, `createPolityRegistry`, `Polity`, `PolityRegistry`,
    `PolityPair` (`src/polity.ts`), `stepTechDiffusion`, `computeDiffusionPressure`,
    `totalInboundPressure`, `techEraName` (`src/tech-diffusion.ts`), and
    `applyEmotionalContagion`, `stepEmotionalWaves`, `computeEmotionalSpread`,
    `triggerMilitaryRout`, `triggerVictoryRally`, `netEmotionalPressure`,
    `EmotionalWave` (`src/emotional-contagion.ts`) from Tier 2 (Experimental)
    to Tier 1 (Stable) in `STABLE_API.md`.
  - Add `export *` re-exports to `src/polity.ts` so the `ananke/polity` subpath
    delivers the complete Socio-Economic Campaign Layer in one import.
  - Freeze `Polity`, `PolityRegistry`, `PolityPair` and `EmotionalWave` interfaces
    with `@stable CE-14` JSDoc annotations — no required-field additions without a
    minor bump, no renames without a major bump.

### Migration guide — v0.1.x → v0.2.0

This is a **non-breaking promotion**.  No existing code needs to change.

#### What is new

The Socio-Economic Campaign Layer (`polity`, `tech-diffusion`, `emotional-contagion`)
is now Tier 1 (Stable).  You can depend on it without fear of silent API churn.

#### Import change (optional)

Instead of importing from the package root:

```typescript
import { stepPolityDay }       from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke";
import { stepTechDiffusion }   from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke";
import { applyEmotionalContagion } from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke";
```

You may now import from the dedicated subpath (recommended for tree-shaking):

```typescript
import {
  stepPolityDay,
  stepTechDiffusion,
  applyEmotionalContagion,
  EmotionalWave,
} from "@its-not-rocket-science/ananke/polity";
```

Both forms remain supported indefinitely.

#### Interface freeze guarantees (from v0.2.0)

| Interface | Guarantee |
|-----------|-----------|
| `Polity` | Existing fields never renamed/removed without major bump |
| `PolityRegistry` | `polities`, `activeWars`, `alliances` fields frozen |
| `PolityPair` | `polityAId`, `polityBId`, `sharedLocations`, `routeQuality_Q` frozen |
| `EmotionalWave` | `profileId`, `sourcePolityId`, `intensity_Q`, `daysActive` frozen |

Adding new **optional** fields to these interfaces is never a breaking change.

---

## [0.1.11] — 2026-03-24

  ### Added

  - **Export Presets, Weapons, Channels, Traits, Kinds from Package Root** (`src/parallel.ts`)
    - Five modules were documented as Tier 1 stable but missing from src/index.ts.
      mkKnight/mkBoxer/etc., weapon arrays, DamageChannel, TraitId, CommandKinds
      and related symbols are now importable directly from the package root.
      Fix STABLE_API.md: WEAPONS was a phantom name; correct to ALL_HISTORICAL_MELEE etc.

  ### Added

  - **CE-16 · Modding Support — HashMod, Post-tick Hooks, Behaviour Node Registry** (`src/parallel.ts`)
    - Three-layer modding contract: FNV-1a data fingerprinting, observational
      post-tick hooks, and named AI behaviour node factories. computeModManifest()
      provides a single session fingerprint for multiplayer client validation.
    - exported via src/index.ts.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-03-24

  ### Added

  - **CE-7 · Spatial Partitioning API for WebWorker Support** (`src/parallel.ts`)
    - Add partitionWorld / mergePartitions / detectBoundaryPairs /
      assignEntitiesToPartitions / canonicaliseBoundaryPairs.  Boundary pairs
      are sorted in canonical (min-id first) order to preserve determinism
      across partitions.
    - Export via src/index.ts

## [0.1.7] — 2026-03-23

  ### Added

  - **CE-9 · World-state Diffing and Incremental Snapshots** (`src/sim/cover.ts`)
    - diffWorldState(prev, next): top-level-field diff per entity; world
      scalar/subsystem diffs; added/removed entity tracking
    - applyDiff(base, diff): reconstruct next state (non-mutating, copy-on-write)
    - packDiff(diff): custom binary encoding — magic "ANKD", tagged-value
      format (null/bool/uint8/int32/float64/string/array/object); zero
      external dependencies, implemented with DataView/Uint8Array
    - unpackDiff(bytes): full round-trip with magic and version validation
    - isDiffEmpty(), diffStats() — helpers for logging and network budgeting
    - 30 tests; verified binary size < full JSON for single-entity changes
    - Export via src/index.ts

---

## [0.1.6] — 2026-03-23

  ### Added

  - **CE-15 · Dynamic Terrain Cover System** (`src/sim/cover.ts`)
    - CoverSegment type: axis-aligned obstacle with material, height, burn state
    - isLineOfSightBlocked(): pure integer segment-intersection test (no sqrt)
    - computeCoverProtection(): multiplicative absorption across stacked cover
    - arcClearsCover(): indirect/lob fire height check
    - applyExplosionToTerrain(): proximity-scaled crater + wood ignition
    - stepCoverDecay(): wood burn-out and crater erosion over real time
    - 4 sample presets: stone wall, sandbag barricade, wooden palisade, dirt berm
    - 60 tests
    - Export via src/index.ts

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-03-21

  ### Added

  - **CE-12 · Data-Driven Entity Catalog** (`src/catalog.ts`, `./catalog` subpath export)
    - `registerArchetype(json)` — parse JSON archetype with base inheritance (`HUMAN_BASE`,
      `AMATEUR_BOXER`, `SERVICE_ROBOT`, etc.) and SI → SCALE unit conversion
    - `registerWeapon(json)` — parse JSON weapon with damage profile; `reach_m` / `readyTime_s`
      converted to SCALE; all ratio fields → Q
    - `registerArmour(json)` — parse JSON armour; `protects` from channel-name strings →
      `ChannelMask`; `coverageByRegion` values → Q
    - `getCatalogEntry(id)` / `listCatalog(kind?)` / `unregisterCatalogEntry(id)` /
      `clearCatalog()` for lifecycle management
    - All numeric values in JSON are real-world SI units; conversion is automatic

  - **Phase 68 · Multi-Biome Physics** (`src/sim/biome.ts`)
    - `BiomeContext` interface with `gravity_mps2`, `thermalResistanceBase`, `dragMul`,
      `soundPropagation`, `isVacuum` overrides
    - Built-in profiles: `BIOME_UNDERWATER`, `BIOME_LUNAR`, `BIOME_VACUUM`
    - Gravity threads into `deriveMovementCaps` (jump height, traction); drag applied per tick
      in movement step; thermal resistance base overrides `stepCoreTemp`; vacuum fatigue
      accumulates in kernel (+3 Q/tick)
    - `KernelContext.biome?` field; fully backwards-compatible (absent = Earth defaults)

---

## [0.1.3] — 2026-03-20

### Changed

- `src/index.ts` (CE-4) now exports only the Tier 1 stable surface defined in `STABLE_API.md`.
  Tier 2 (experimental) and Tier 3 (internal) exports have been removed from the root barrel
  and are accessible via direct module paths (e.g. `dist/src/sim/aging.js`).
- `createWorld`, `loadScenario`, `validateScenario`, `ARCHETYPE_MAP`, `ITEM_MAP` promoted to
  Tier 1 (were incorrectly placed under Tier 3 in 0.1.2).
- `describeCharacter`, `formatCharacterSheet`, `formatOneLine` added to root barrel (were
  listed as Tier 1 in `STABLE_API.md` but missing from the 0.1.2 export).

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-19

### Added

- `createWorld(seed, entities)` — Tier-1 convenience factory; builds a `WorldState` from
  `EntitySpec[]` (archetype, weapon, armour string IDs) without manual entity construction
- `loadScenario(json)` / `validateScenario(json)` — JSON-driven world creation for
  non-TypeScript consumers (Godot GDScript, Unity C#, scenario files)
- `ARCHETYPE_MAP` — `ReadonlyMap` of all 21 built-in archetypes (7 base + 14 species)
- `ITEM_MAP` — `ReadonlyMap` of all historical and starter weapons/armour

---

### Documentation

- Replace root `README.md` with a focused programmer's guide (installation, three
  quick-start examples, core concepts, command reference, determinism rules, replay,
  bridge, API tier table, TypeScript types, performance guidance)
- Preserve full original README as `docs/project-overview.md`
- Publish `docs/` reference suite in npm tarball: host-contract, integration-primer,
  bridge-contract, performance, versioning, emergent-validation-report, project-overview
